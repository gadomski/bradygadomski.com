<p class="c1"><span>Hello&nbsp;all,</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3"><span class="caps">PLEASE</span> REPLY TO THIS EMAIL. The
location of our celebration changed and we need to confirm</span>
<span class="c3 c6">all</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;our guests are
on the same&nbsp;page.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>We hope this email finds you well, happily
finishing up a great&nbsp;summer!</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c10"><strong>Our celebration will be in</span>
<span class="c6 c10">Mount Shasta</span><span class="c10">,
California,</span> <span class="c10 c3 c11">not at the Bar 717
Ranch</span><span class="c10">!!! The celebration will still take
place on September 12<span class="ord">th</span>,&nbsp;2015.</strong></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>We want to make sure you head to the right
place for our big party! We have also posted this letter to our
website, <a href="http://bradygadomski.com">http://bradygadomski.com</a>.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>Due to ongoing fires in the area and on the
property of the Bar 717 Ranch, we have been forced to</span>
<span class="c6">change the location of our
celebration</span><span>. The</span> <span class="c6">date and time
will not change</span><span>, we will still be celebrating the
weekend of September 11<span class="ord">th</span>, 12<span class="ord">th</span>, and 13<span class="ord">th</span>, but our location will
now be in the town of Mount Shasta in Northern California. The
celebration will be at the Mount Shasta City Park, and the
reception will be at the Mount Shasta Dance Hall
(</span><span class="c8"><a class="c0" href=

As you might imagine, we did not come to this decision lightly, but
we feel as it is the right thing to do given the situation at camp.
If you are interested, please see the bottom of this email for
information about the fires and links to where you can learn&nbsp;more.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span>Mount Shasta (</span><span class="c8"><a class=
"c0" href=
"https://goo.gl/maps/uvJJO">https://goo.gl/maps/uvJJO</a></span><span>)
is about a one hour drive north of Redding, <span class="caps">CA</span>, right on Interstate
5. It is located in a beautiful area near Mt. Shasta, a fourteen
thousand foot mountain. All of your original travel plans will
still work to get you here, you&rsquo;ll just drive to Mount Shasta
instead of to camp &mdash; the drive to Mt. Shasta is shorter and
straighter. If you have any issues or questions, please let us&nbsp;know.</span></p>

<h2 class="c1 c5"><a name="h.o5g0py3g61pj" id=
"h.o5g0py3g61pj"></a><span>Information about the&nbsp;fires</span></h2>
<p class="c1"><span>On July 30<span class="ord">th</span>, 2015 a large number of lightning
strikes ignited fires all around Northern California, including
near Hyampom, <span class="caps">CA</span> and the Bar 717 Ranch. Many fires have continued
to burn throughout the area, requiring large amounts of manpower
and equipment throughout the region. One fire in particular, the
Pattison Fire, started north of camp and has been moving south and
west slowly over the past couple of weeks. It currently is close to
camp property, but has not yet damaged any&nbsp;structures.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>When the fires started, camp was in session.
All campers and staff were safe and ok throughout the entire
process. Due to the continued fire danger, camp was forced to
cancel its fourth of four sessions as well as the two &ldquo;family
camp&rdquo; sessions scheduled later in the&nbsp;summer.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>Camp itself, as we write this, is ok, though it
is very smoky and everyone has been working very hard to keep
things ship-shape. You can mointor the status of the South Complex
of fires, which includes the Pattison Fire, here:</span>
<span class="c8"><a class="c0" href=
"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Finciweb.nwcg.gov%2Fincident%2F4442%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGe8HXXV-pzM9AW0eL6euwdbyC2uw">
http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/4442/</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>If you would like to make a donation to help
camp, we suggest donating to their campership fund, which enables
campers who could not otherwise afford camp to attend. You can
donate online here:</span> <span class="c8"><a class="c0" href=
"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bar717.com%2Fabout-us%2Fcampership%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2y0uNTHEIV14BGhxdQcFWkPvTdg">
http://www.bar717.com/about-us/campership/</a></span><span>. While
camp has had fires before and has been able to bounce back, it is
always hard to send campers home. We wish them the best getting
through this situation and bouncing back next&nbsp;year.</span></p>
