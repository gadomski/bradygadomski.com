# The Fires at Camp

On July 30th, 2015 a large number of lightning strikes ignited fires all around Northern California, including near Hyampom, CA and the Bar 717 Ranch. Many fires have continued to burn throughout the area, requiring large amounts of manpower and equipment throughout the region. One fire in particular, the Pattison Fire, started north of camp and has been moving south and west slowly over the past couple of weeks. It currently is close to camp property, but has not yet damaged any structures.

When the fires started, camp was in session. All campers and staff were safe and ok throughout the entire process. Due to the continued fire danger, camp was forced to cancel its fourth of four sessions as well as the two “family camp” sessions scheduled later in the summer.

Camp itself, as we write this, is ok, though it is very smoky and everyone has been working very hard to keep things ship-shape. You can mointor the status of the South Complex of fires, which includes the Pattison Fire, here: http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/4442/.

If you would like to make a donation to help camp, we suggest donating to their campership fund, which enables campers who could not otherwise afford camp to attend. You can donate online here: http://www.bar717.com/about-us/campership/. While camp has had fires before and has been able to bounce back, it is always hard to send campers home. We wish them the best getting through this situation and bouncing back next year.
