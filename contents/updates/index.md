We'll try to post some updates here as planning progresses.
Can't wait to see you in September!

# August 25, 2015

Due to ongoing fires at and around the Bar 717, we have been forced to change the location of our wedding celebration to Mount Shasta, California.
Please see [our main page](/) for more complete information.
If you are planning on attending our big party and have not emailed us since the location change, **please email us at bradygadomski@gmail.com**.
We need to get in touch with all guests to ensure they arrive at the correct location.

Thanks folks, we appreciate the flexibility and understanding.

&mdash; Pete
