# The Location

The Bar 717 Ranch is located between Hayfork and Hyampom, California, nestled into the steep hills and valleys of Trinity County.
During the summer, the ranch is the site of Camp Trinity, a coeducational summer camp for kids aged eight to seventeen; Kelly and Pete met when they were both counselors at the camp.
You can find out more about the camp's history [on their website](http://www.bar717.com/history/).

## Getting There

The Bar 717 Ranch is located about two hours west of Redding, California, and is generally assessable only by private vehicle, no shuttles or buses are available.
[See where the camp is on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bar+717+Ranch/@40.6205833,-123.3770636,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54d3bd20c45d22b5:0x636ee857e506bb94).
The Bar 717 website also has some [hand written directions](http://www.bar717.com/about-us/location/) to the ranch.

If you are looking to fly in from around the country, [Redding](http://www.ci.redding.ca.us/transeng/airports/index.htm) and [Eureka/Arcata](https://plus.google.com/100151413109057686697/about?gl=us&hl=en) are both about two hours from camp.
[Sacramento](http://www.sacramento.aero/smf/) is only about four hours from camp, and [San Francisco](http://www.flysfo.com/) is the closest large airport.

We want to do our best to help people get to our celebration, so if you are willing to provide a carpool or need a ride, please [email us](mailto:kp@bradygadomski.com)


## Accommodations

In general, life on the Bar 717 Ranch can best be described as "rustic", but we will have a wide variety of lodging options available to our guests, including handicap-accessible rooms.
Many of our guests will also be camping out, which could be a fun and affordable option and a great way to get to experience the beautiful area!

Lodging reservations will begin when official invitations are sent out, and will be made through Pete and Kelly.

We will do our best to connect people who are looking to do similar activities, and will provide detailed information about some of our favorite spots.
