# The Location

The Bar 717 Ranch is located between Hayfork and Hyampom, California, nestled into the steep hills and valleys of Trinity County.
During the summer, the ranch is the site of Camp Trinity, a coeducational summer camp for kids aged eight to seventeen; Kelly and Pete met when they were both counselors at the camp.
You can find out more about the camp's history [on their website](http://www.bar717.com/history/).

## Getting There

The Bar 717 Ranch is located about two hours west of Redding, California, and is generally assessable only by private vehicle, no shuttles or buses are available.
[See where the camp is on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bar+717+Ranch/@40.6205833,-123.3770636,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54d3bd20c45d22b5:0x636ee857e506bb94).
The Bar 717 website also has some [hand written directions](http://www.bar717.com/about-us/location/) to the ranch.

If you are looking to fly in from around the country, [Redding](http://www.ci.redding.ca.us/transeng/airports/index.htm) and [Eureka/Arcata](https://plus.google.com/100151413109057686697/about?gl=us&hl=en) are both about two hours from camp.
[Sacramento](http://www.sacramento.aero/smf/) is only about four hours from camp, and [San Francisco](http://www.flysfo.com/) is the closest large airport.
[Portland](http://www.portofportland.com/PDX_Home.aspx) is another option.

We want to do our best to help people get to our celebration, so if you are willing to provide a carpool or need a ride, please [email us](mailto:bradygadomski@gmail.com).

### Rental cars in Redding

If you're looking to rent a car in Redding, CA, unfortunately you usually can't rent a car after 3pm in Redding, which is after the flights get in.
If this is going to cause you problems, contact us and we can help sort something out to make sure you can make it to the celebration!


## Accommodations

All guests will be staying on platforms unless otherwise arranged by Kelly and Pete.
Here's the description of platforms from the camp website:

> On the Ranch we have more then 20 Platforms.  These sleeping structures are our own invention, perfectly adapted to our summer climate of warm, dry days and cool nights.  A Platform is a cabin-like structure with 3 walls and a roof, open on 1 side to views of the pasture or forest.  Platforms are grouped into living areas, each no more than a few minutes walk from the main camp area.  Each platform sleeps from 6 to 15 people and has a sink and bathroom.  Shower houses are short walk away.

We are asking that guests bring a sleeping bag or other bedding for the weekend.
Temperatures this time of year usually range from the 80s to 90s during the day to the 40s and 50s at night ([see historical records and averages](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KO54/2015/9/16/MonthlyCalendar.html?req_city=Hyampom&req_state=CA&req_statename=&reqdb.zip=96046&reqdb.magic=1&reqdb.wmo=99999)).
See [our packing list](#packing-list) for a more complete list of things you will need for the weekend.

If you have any questions or issues with the housing, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## Meals

As a part of the weekend, we will be providing meals at the ranch starting with dinner on Friday and running through Sunday morning breakfast.
There are also restaurants in Hyampom and Hayfork, both of which are about thirty minutes away from the ranch.


# Things to Do

While we don't have a ton of scheduled activities for the weekend, there will be plenty going on at the ranch and in the surrounding area.
We encourage you to get out and explore the area as much as you can!
We will do our best to connect people who are looking to do similar activities, and will provide detailed information about some of our favorite spots.

Here's a couple of ideas to inspire you:

<div class="media">
<span class="pull-left"><img class="media-object thumbnail" src="river.jpg" alt="The River"></span>
<div class="media-body">
  <h4 class="media-heading">The River</h4>
  <p>
    A tried and true standby of every counselor on her day off, chilling by the river is a great way to while away the day.
    Hayfork Creek runs right through the ranch, and the [South Fork of the Trinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Fork_Trinity_River) is just a short drive away.
    You can be sure people will be headed to the river every day.

<span class="pull-left"><img class="media-object thumbnail" src="hiking.jpg" alt="Hiking"></span>
<div class="media-body">
  <h4 class="media-heading">Hiking</h4>
  <p>
    The ranch itself has miles of trails that can keep you occupied for days, or even a whole summer.
    The nearby [Trinity Alps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Alps) provide wonderful granite terrain for day hikes or multi-day adventures.

<div class="media">
<span class="pull-left"><img class="media-object thumbnail" src="biking.jpg" alt="Biking"></span>
<div class="media-body">
  <h4 class="media-heading">Biking</h4>
  <p>
    If you're able to get a bike to the ranch, there's miles of forest service roads, trails, and paved roads for you to explore.
  </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="media">
<span class="pull-left"><img class="media-object thumbnail" src="ranch.jpg" alt="Goats"></span>
<div class="media-body">
  <h4 class="media-heading">Just Relax</h4>
  <p>
    And of course, there's going to be plenty of time to kick back, open a beverage, and catch up with friends and family.
    Maybe a goat, too.
