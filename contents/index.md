# If You Are Attending...

If you haven't emailed us since August 25th, 2015, please email us at <bradygadomski@gmail.com> to confirm that you are aware of the change in location from the Bar 717 to Mount Shasta.
In your email, please include:

- Your plans for lodging
- If you are camping, do you need any camping equipment?
- Any additional guests that you are “responding for”
- Any concerns or questions that you have

We insist upon this so we can be sure that no guests will show up at the Bar 717.
Thank you for understanding and your flexibility.


# The Location

Mount Shasta is located on Interstate 5 about an hour north of Redding, California.
It is a beautiful small town in the shadow of a fourteen-thousand foot mountain.

We want to do our best to help people get to our celebration, so if you are willing to provide a carpool or need a ride, please [email us](mailto:bradygadomski@gmail.com).


## Getting There

If you are looking to fly in from around the country, [Redding](http://www.ci.redding.ca.us/transeng/airports/index.htm) and [Eureka/Arcata](https://plus.google.com/100151413109057686697/about?gl=us&hl=en) are both about two hours from camp.
[Sacramento](http://www.sacramento.aero/smf/) is only about four hours from camp, and [San Francisco](http://www.flysfo.com/) is the closest large airport.
[Portland](http://www.portofportland.com/PDX_Home.aspx) is another option.

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you're looking to rent a car in Redding, CA, unfortunately you usually can't rent a car after 3pm in Redding, which is after the flights get in.
If this is going to cause you problems, contact us and we can help sort something out to make sure you can make it to the celebration!
